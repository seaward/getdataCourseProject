Run ```{r}run_analysis``` to generate tidy data from collected accelerometer data from Samsung Galaxy S.

The accelerometer data is here: <https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip>. Download it to working directory, unzip it, then run ```{r}run_analysis``` to generate tiday datasets.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
